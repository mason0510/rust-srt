00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,100
Welcome to this introduction to the blockchain.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,520
First, we're going to answer the question What is the blockchain?

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,920
I blockchain is a ledger that is shared and immutable.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,170
Firstly, what's a ledger?

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,980
Well, Ledger is a place where transactions are recorded, transactions like you sending money to your

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,240
friend or a company selling a product and receiving some money in return.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,290
Now, let's focus on shared and immutable.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,320
A blockchain is shared because everyone can view the ledger and everyone can see the same copy of the

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,740
ledger.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,270
This is different from, say, a banks ledger in a banks ledger.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,830
The bank can see all the transactions, but you can only see your transactions.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,850
But in a blockchain, you can see all the transactions.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,670
The blockchain is also immutable, immutable means it can't be changed.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,560
And what that means is once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it's permanent.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,160
You can't remove the transaction or change the transaction.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,460
Let's look into more detail about how a blockchain works AI blockchain is literally a chain of blocks.

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,670
Each block contains a list of transactions.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,090
As each transaction occurs, it's recorded into a block.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,970
Multiple transactions are added to the block.

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,640
Then the block is added to the end of the existing blockchain in a process called mining.

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,090
And what's special about mining is that it means that once a transaction is stored on the blockchain,

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,860
it cannot be changed.

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,760
The exact mechanism, why is not something I'm going to cover in this video, because that would require

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,270
a long winded discussion on cryptography hashes the nonsense which isn't necessary for you to start

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,470
programming for Solana.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,400
But it's worth mentioning that mining is the reason why the blockchain is immutable.

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,740
What are the benefits of the blockchain?

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,100
There are three decentralization of trust, immutability and security.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,820
Decentralization of trust, this is so special and unique to the blockchain, the way finance works

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,630
now, we delegate the trust of our money over to a third party.

31
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,750
I bet that right now you have some money stored in a bank because you trust the bank to give you your

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,770
money when you need it.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,000
With the blockchain, though, you don't need to trust a third party like a bank to control your money.

34
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,340
You can trust the blockchain itself.

35
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,960
And what that means is that you don't have to worry about the bank taking a long time to give you your

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,450
money and you don't have to worry about bank fees.

37
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,160
Immutability is another benefit once a transaction is added onto the blockchain.

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,950
It is impossible for that transaction to be changed.

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,490
This is important because it prevents fraud and manipulation and provides us with increased transparency.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,430
You don't have to worry about your bank being corrupt.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,260
And security.

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,960
It's much, much, much more difficult to hack into the blockchain than into a bank.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,790
Blockchain uses cryptography and algorithms of consensus to have a practically unbreakable security.

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,180
To be able to also record it would be necessary to control or deceive at least 51 percent of the network,

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,220
which in terms of hardware and electricity costs, make this practically impossible.

46
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,840
I mentioned banks a fair amount in this video.

47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,940
A lot of people are investing in the blockchain because they believe that the blockchain will eventually

48
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,930
replace banks.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,490
It's quite a long term goal.

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,460
Banks still operate today, but that's why you're so lucky because you're watching this video and following

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:53,400
this course, now you are early by learning about the blockchain and how to develop for the blockchain.

52
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,250
Now you all leagues ahead of the rest in a technology that will change the world.
